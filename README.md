This repository contains code that implements the cryptosystem detailed in https://eprint.iacr.org/2017/481.pdf.

The specific implementation can be found in src/mersenne_cryptosystem. To better understand the implementation, it is best if you have the code and paper side by side.

project.ipynb contains a showcase of the implementation

I will also leave two links to repositories that I used as reference:

[1] - https://github.com/thenaesh/mersenne-pkc. This repository implements bit-by-bit encryption in Rust.

[2] - https://github.com/sraaphorst/reed-muller-python. I used the report as a reference to implement Reed Muller codes.
